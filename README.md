# Create a children's story with OpenAI

This project uses OpenAI's API to create a 'Make your own adventure' style story.  
The app provides character and story prompts or you can type your own.  
When you ask to tell a story it'll create an image for the story and start a story.  
When the story is made you can give a prompt on how you'd like the story to develop or ask it to conclude.   
This was built with my children in mind as a fun way to play with Open AI and (hopefully) encourage my children to enjoy reading more  

## How to set up

Download project  
Run npm build  
Run npm start  

You'll need an API key from Open AI here https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication  
And you'll need to add that in a .env.local file   
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
